# Simple's Virtual Machine's for PLang

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple virtual machine (VM) in Multi-language, capable of executing a custom assembly language, called `PLang`, with file extensions `.pasm`.

The VM supports basic operations such as pushing and popping values from a stack, casting values, duplicating values, jumping to labels, and basic arithmetic operations.

## Features

- **Custom Assembly Language**: The VM executes a custom assembly language defined by a set of instructions.
- **Stack-Based Operations**: Supports basic stack operations like push, pop, and arithmetic operations.
- **Type Checking**: Ensures operations are performed on compatible types.
- **Labels and Jumps**: Supports defining labels and jumping to them.
- **Logging**: Includes a basic logging mechanism to report errors and warnings.
